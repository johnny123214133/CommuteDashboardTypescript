# Commute Dashboard

This version of the project uses React + Typescript. I built it to start teaching myself Typescript.

## Obtaining Google Maps API Key and Map ID

I did not include my key and ID in this repository. Follow the instructions listed below to set up and use your own keys
in this project:

1. [Google Maps API Key Setup](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) If restricting your key's access, ensure that your key is given Route and Places API permissions
2. [Google Maps Map ID Setup](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/get-map-id) You just need to complete the steps through generating an ID

## Running the Project

After cloning the repo:

1. add your API key and map ID to the `.env` file
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

## Todo

Now that I've adapted the original React + JavaScript project into React + Typescript, I plan to:

1. Clean up the code a bit
2. Refactor added interfaces adopting best practices
3. Refactor Component code adopting best practices
